# Intro

Remember our adventure in [Going Modular ‚Äî The Kotlin Multiplatform Way?](https://thomaskioko.me/posts/going_modular_the_kotlin_multiplatform_way/) Well, this is a continuation of that. (Sort of üòÅ). I say sort of because this article focuses on the Swift side of things. We will explore how creating UI components in a separate Swift package can significantly improve the development experience when working on the iOS App.

If you are interested in the code, [here is the Pull Request](https://github.com/thomaskioko/tv-maniac/pull/286). Let's get this party started.

## The KMM Preview Headache ü§ï

While working with KMM on iOS, one of my biggest headaches is that Previews don't load in XCode. I don't know why XCode does not play nice with KMM. It either takes too long to load or fails. The only way to see what I am creating is by running the application. This is frustrating as it slows development time.


## Enter Separate Swift Packages üì¶
By relocating our UI components into a separate Swift package, we're not just organizing our code, but we're also unlocking a host of benefits that can significantly enhance our development experience:

1. **Functional SwiftUI Previews**
    - By isolating views from the KMM framework, providing real-time UI development feedback, and improving the developer experience, we can load views faster.

2. **Improved Reusability**

    - Components can be easily reused across the application, leading to a more modular architecture and reducing code duplication.


3. **Streamlined Testing**

    - With this in place, Snapshot testing becomes a viable option for ensuring UI consistency. Coming soon. ü§ì


4. **Optimized Project Structure**

    - A clear structure makes it easy to maintain and update our components.


### App structure:

I ended up creating two packages:

- **SwiftUIComponents:** This package includes common views used in various screens. Colors, Buttons, CardView, PosterImage etc
- **TVManiacUI:** This Package includes Screen UI Views. eg. CastList, TrailerList, ShowInfoView. etc

Below is what the structure of the App looks like.

```
TvManiac/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (Kotlin shared code)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ androidApp/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (Android-specific code)

‚îÇ       ‚îÇ                 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CollapsibleView.swift
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TrailerItemView.swift
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TVManiacUI/
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Package.swift
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sources/
‚îÇ               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TVManiacUI/
‚îÇ                   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄModels/
‚îÇ                       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SwiftCast.swift
‚îÇ                       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SwiftTrailer.swift
‚îÇ                   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CastListView.swift
‚îÇ                   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ShowInfoView.swift
‚îÇ                   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProviderListView.swift
‚îÇ                   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```


## Implementing the Approach üöß
Integrating a package in XCode is a straightforward process. These are the steps I followed: 

1. **Package Creation and Configuration**

- Create a new Swift package (`SwiftUIComponents`) using your preferred method (Xcode UI or Swift Package Manager CLI).
- Configure the `Package.swift` file to specify iOS deployment target and any necessary dependencies.


2. **Component Migration**

- Migrate SwiftUI views and components from your KMP iOS project to the new package.
- Refactor as needed to ensure components are self-contained and don't rely on KMM-specific code.


3. **Dependency Management**

- If your UI components require a specific package, use Swift Package Manager's dependency declaration to manage package relationships. In my case, I added `SDWebImageSwiftUI` and `YouTubePlayerKit` and removed them from the main app.


4. **Final Step**

- In your main iOS project, go to File > Add Packages.
- Select `SwiftUIComponents` package.
- (Optional)** Create a new scheme and select the framework, in this case, `SwiftUIComponents.` This allows us to switch between the Main app and the UI package.

With that in place, here's an example of how the project structure looks after implementing this approach. ü•≥

# Conclusion
I highly recommend trying this approach. It's made my life easier, my code cleaner, and the general structure better. Next, we might add snapshot tests, a CI/CD job, and more cleanup. 

A big shoutout to my colleague Daniel. If you ever read this, thanks for being the best second-class mobile citizen. Until we meet again, folks.

Happy coding! ‚úåÔ∏è
